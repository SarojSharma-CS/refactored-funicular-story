Paul was cramming for his CS400term.
terms for three other classes.
He decided to continue to study and not sleep for the night. 

After studying all night and not sleeping...

Paul decided to make breakfast but his eggs were expired. This made him feel
bad because Paul told himself he was going to eat more eggs and essentially wasted
money by not eating them. 

He sprinted outside...

And in his hurry he didn't look both and was hit by a bus but not just any bus a UW-Madison bus. 

It was full of student atheletes so you know what that means. If paul can survive his injuries he gets FREE TUTITION!
